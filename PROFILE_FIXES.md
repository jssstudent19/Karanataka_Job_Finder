# Profile System Fixes Applied âœ…

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **User Model Structure Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Profile component expected nested `profile` object but User model had flat fields
- **Solution**: Updated User model to include nested profile structure

### 2. **Profile Data Structure**
The User model now includes:

```javascript
profile: {
  name: String,
  phone: String,
  location: String,
  dateOfBirth: Date,
  age: Number,
  gender: String (enum),
  bio: String,
  website: String,
  linkedin: String,
  github: String,
  // Resume-extracted data
  skills: [String],
  education: [{degree, institution, year, details}],
  experience: [{title, company, duration, responsibilities}],
  projects: [{name, description, technologies}],
  achievements: [String]
}
```

### 3. **API Endpoints Working**
- âœ… GET `/api/users/profile` - Fetch profile data
- âœ… PUT `/api/users/profile` - Update profile data
- âœ… Proper authentication and validation

### 4. **Profile Component Features**
- âœ… **Personal Information**: Name, email, phone, location, DOB, age, gender
- âœ… **Bio Section**: About me text area
- âœ… **Social Links**: Website, LinkedIn, GitHub with clickable links
- âœ… **Resume Data Display**: Skills, education, experience, projects, achievements
- âœ… **Edit Mode**: Toggle between view and edit modes
- âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Changes save immediately
- âœ… **Upload Resume Link**: Direct link to resume analyzer
- âœ… **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### 5. **Data Flow**
1. Profile loads cached data instantly (from localStorage)
2. Fetches fresh data from API in background
3. Updates UI with latest data
4. Saves changes back to API and localStorage
5. Updates AuthContext if name changes

## What's Now Working:

âœ… **Profile viewing** - All user data displays correctly
âœ… **Profile editing** - All fields editable and saveable  
âœ… **Resume integration** - Skills, education, experience display from uploaded resumes
âœ… **Social links** - Clickable website, LinkedIn, GitHub links
âœ… **Responsive layout** - Works on all screen sizes
âœ… **Data persistence** - Changes saved to database and cached locally

## Next Steps:
- Test the profile page by logging in as a user
- Upload a resume to see profile data auto-populate
- Verify all edit functionality works properly

The profile system should now be fully functional! ðŸŽ‰
