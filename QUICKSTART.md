# Quick Start Guide - Karnataka Job Portal

## Current Status

✅ Testing infrastructure setup complete
✅ Test files created (auth, jobs)  
✅ Dependencies installed
⏳ Backend implementation in progress
⏳ Frontend to be created

## What We Have

1. **Testing Setup**
   - Jest configuration
   - MongoDB Memory Server for tests
   - Mock data helpers
   - Integration tests for auth and jobs

2. **Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Testing guide
   - Deployment guide

3. **Dependencies**
   - All npm packages installed
   - Test framework ready

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Backend First (RECOMMENDED)
Since we have tests written, we can implement the backend using TDD (Test-Driven Development):

1. Create User model
2. Create auth routes/controllers
3. Run auth tests
4. Create Job model
5. Create job routes/controllers
6. Run job tests
7. Continue with remaining features

### Option 2: Start Frontend While Backend is Minimal
Create a basic frontend that can:
- Register/Login
- View jobs (mocked data)
- Apply for jobs
- View applications

Then connect to real backend as features are built.

### Option 3: Build Complete MVP Backend Quickly
I can generate all the backend files from my previous work (since I have the complete architecture documented), then immediately start frontend.

## Recommendation

**Let's do Option 3**: I'll quickly generate the core backend files (models, routes, controllers) that we've already designed, get the server running, then immediately jump to frontend development.

This way:
- Backend runs locally in 10-15 minutes
- We can test APIs with Postman
- Frontend can start connecting to real endpoints
- Tests validate everything works

## Commands to Run After Backend is Ready

```bash
# Start MongoDB (if local)
# Make sure MongoDB is running

# Start backend
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run tests
npm test

# In another terminal, start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Environment Setup

Create `.env` file:
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/karnataka_jobs_dev
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
SCRAPING_ENABLED=false
```

Ready to proceed?
